Kirk wanted to shake Spock's hand as a sign of fare well, so moved his hands forward. Spock couldn't find out what Kirk wants, so reacted as usuall, holded his right hand up with his fingers shaping a V sign.
Long live and prosper... said Spock.
Jim was a bit cluless, so he decided to try and mimic what Spock did.
Long live and prosper Spock...
